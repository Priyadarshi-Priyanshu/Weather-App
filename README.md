# Weather-App

The Weather App is a Django-based web application that allows users to view current weather information for multiple cities. The app uses OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather data for a given city.

The application has the following functionalities:

Users can add cities to their list and view the current weather data for each city.
Users can remove a city from their list.
The app displays the temperature, description, and weather icon for each city.
The app also provides a notification message for successful and failed actions.
The Weather App is built using Django, a Python-based web framework, and uses HTML/CSS for the front-end design. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where the models define the data structure, views handle the application logic and user interface, and controllers manage user requests and responses.

The app uses Django's built-in forms to handle user input and Django's ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to interact with the database. It also uses Django's templating engine to dynamically generate the HTML for the user interface.

Overall, the Weather App provides a simple and user-friendly interface to view the current weather data for multiple cities, making it a useful tool for people who want to keep track of weather conditions in different locations.
